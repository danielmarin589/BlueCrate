# BlueCrate
A Python-based website that I developed in the 2nd year of college. It is meant for rating and reviewing the latest movies. As a user you can register/log in and search for whatever movie you like, select it and then see the trailer, summary of the story, cast and at the bottom of the page you can leave a review and a rating. All of the data(user info, cast info, movies, user reviews etc) was stored in a database which would get updated after every review/user registration. The project was developed mainly using Django and SQLite. I also want to mention that it was my first ever Python/Django project.
